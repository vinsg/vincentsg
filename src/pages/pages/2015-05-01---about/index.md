Hi there 👋  

I'm **Vincent**, a cloud native developer with a passion for large data applications, serverless and distributed systems in the cloud. I also have strong interests in various technologies in the field of Geospatial Information System, OSINT and Intelligence Analysis. While not working, I practice MMA and hike around the mountains of British Columbia.

Previously at Desjardins, I helped modernized banking infrastructure tools and reporting.  

**I am currently looking for new challenges, feel free to connect with me via my email (vincent.salamancag@gmail.com).**
